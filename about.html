	<h1> About </h1>
	<h3> About Pc Auctions </h3>
	<p> Pc Auctions is a website developed for the Curricular Unit LBAW, part of the Integrated Masters in Inphormatics Engineering. Made with love, care and a lot of coffee  by 4 students, this website intends to be an online auction service that lets users buy and sell PCs, either pre-made (by which we intend laptops and towers with and without peripheral devices) or by buying components and peripheral devices on their own, for an accessible and dynamic pricing competing with major electronics stores on used parts.</p>
	<p>This system lets the users create an account, enter auctions in order to buy and/or sell items, evaluate the listed items and the sellers, register comments for the items and consult information about other users and items.
